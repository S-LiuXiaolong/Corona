# Description
My small engine based on Chen-Wenli's GameEngineFromScratch
# Build
## Build on Windows
You may execute the build_windows.bat. This batch file will generate the projects.

(Optional) You can build external libraries on your own with the .bat files and put all files to External/your_platform by hand (but not recommanded!).
