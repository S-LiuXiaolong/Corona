## Build on Windows
You may execute the build_windows.bat. This batch file will generate the projects. It is difficult to build ispc on Windows, so please download ispc.exe from Release of https://github.com/ispc/ispc and put the two binary files **ispc.exe** and **ispcrt.dll** into the new created folder (by your own) **External/ispc/Release**.
